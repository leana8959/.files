This is my dotfiles repo

This repo is managed with GNU stow

# This repo contains my configuration for:

## Shell and Text Editors
- `nvim`
- `starship`
- `fish`
- `tmux_sessionizer`: a fish script inspired by
  [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/scripts/tmux-sessionizer),
  allows jumping between different tmux sessions using fzf

## WM and Linux stuff
- `xmonad`
- `xmobar`

I have made a theme (a fork of Atom's one-light) all my tools are visually
unified.

Have fun :)
