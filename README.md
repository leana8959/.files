This is my dotfiles repo

This repo is managed with GNU stow

This repo contains:
- `nvim` config
- `starship` config
- `fish` config
- `tmux_sessionizer`: a fish script inspired by [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/scripts/tmux-sessionizer), allows jumping between different tmux sessions using fzf

I have made a theme where `nvim`, `starship` and `fish` are visually unified.

Have fun :)
