This is my dotfiles repo

This repo is managed with GNU stow  
This repo contains:
- NeoVim config
- starship config
- fish configuration
- tmux_sessionizer: a fish script inspired by [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/scripts/tmux-sessionizer), allows jumping between different tmux sessions using fzf

Have fun :)
